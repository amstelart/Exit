              <p>The report underscores the fact that the capacity of individuals and local communities to cope and adapt to the risks from climate change is very limited without adaptation-planning efforts supported by governments. </p>
              <p>There is need for collaboration among citizens, scientists, the private sector and policymakers to develop feasible adaptation plans, through the integration of different knowledge systems — including local and Indigenous knowledge.</p>

              <h4>H4 — Citizen of a vulnerable country</h4>
              <p>This is the sixth such assessment from the IPCC in a little over three decades, and the warnings have only become more dire. Advocates hope the latest assessment will finally spur governments to tackle the climate crisis decisively.</p>

              <h2>H2 — Key points from the report</h2>
              <p>Some are already experiencing the effects of climate change, which vary by region and are driven by factors such as geography, how that region is governed and its socio-economic status. The report also references for the first time “historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism” that contribute to many regions vulnerability to climate change.</p>
            
              <ul class="custom-num-list">
                <li>Between 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion people — more than 40% of the world’s population — live in places and in situations that are “highly vulnerable to climate change”, the report estimates.</li>
                <li>Although additional finance and planning could help many communities to improve their preparations for climate change, humanity will soon hit “hard limits” to its ability to adapt if temperatures continue to rise, the report says.</li>
                <li>Climate change has already caused death and suffering across the world, and it will continue to do so.</li>
                <li>If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, some environmental changes could become irreversible, depending on the magnitude and duration of the ‘overshoot’ beyond this threshold. </li>
                <li>Sustainable economic development must include protection for biodiversity and natural ecosystems, which secure resources such as fresh water and coastlines that shield against the effects of storms, the report says. </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>H2 — Negative impacts of climate change</h2>
              <p>The most important message coming from the report from my perspective is that losses and damages are widespread and being felt now. Unfortunately, these negative impacts of climate change are disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable and marginalized communities around the world. Also crucial is evidence showing that people and ecosystems are already reaching limits to adaptation, where they have surpassed their capacities to prevent negative impacts of climate change.</p>

              <h3>H3 — Adelle Thomas, a geographer at the University of the Bahamas in Nassau</h3>
              <p>As a scientist from the Bahamas, one of the low-lying coastal countries that are at high risk from climate change, I hope that this report provides an impetus for policymakers to limit warming to 1.5 °C, urgently ramp up adaptation and address loss and damage.</p>
            
              <h3>H3 — Ibidun Adelekan, a geographer at the University</h3>
              <p>The report underscores the fact that the capacity of individuals and local communities to cope and adapt to the risks from climate change is very limited without adaptation-planning efforts supported by governments. There is need for collaboration among citizens, scientists, the private sector and policymakers to develop feasible adaptation plans, through the integration of different knowledge systems — including local and Indigenous knowledge.</p>
              <p>The negative impacts of climate change are mounting much faster than scientists predicted less than a decade ago, according to the latest report from a United Nations climate panel. Many impacts are unavoidable and will hit the world’s most vulnerable populations hardest, it warns — but collective action from governments to both curb greenhouse-gas emissions and prepare communities to live with global warming could yet avert the worst outcomes.</p>
              
              <blockquote>
                <p>The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal. Any further delay in global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The report, released on 28 February, is the second instalment of the latest climate assessment from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Issued last August, the first instalment focused on recent climate science, whereas the latest one looks at the impacts of climate change on people and ecosystems. It will be followed in early April by a third instalment that evaluates humanity’s options for battling climate change, including ways of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
